## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Schema-Driven Form Rendering**  
  Define form structure, fields, validations, and dependencies entirely in JSON â€” no need to hardcode inputs.  
  This allows rapid adjustments to form workflows.

- **Multi-Step Navigation**  
  Organizes complex forms into multiple steps for a better user experience. Users can go back and edit previous steps at any time.

- **Conditional Rendering**  
  Form fields can appear or hide dynamically based on other field values, controlled by schema-defined dependencies.

- **Dynamic Option Loading**  
  Select fields can fetch their options from **external APIs or predefined data sources** dynamically.

- **Real-Time Validation**  
  Validation is powered by **Zod**, with schemas generated directly from the form definition.

- **Integrated EMI Calculator**  
  At the final step, users can calculate their **Equated Monthly Installments** instantly using loan amount, interest rate, and tenure.
